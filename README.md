# StudentScore-Predictor-Linear-Regression-Analysis
A complete Linear Regression implementation that predicts math scores from reading scores using the Kaggle Student Performance dataset. Covers data exploration, preprocessing, model training, visualization, and evaluation.
​

🎯 Project Features
✅ Task 1: Dataset exploration (shape, columns, info, stats)

✅ Task 2: Data preprocessing (missing values, train-test split)

✅ Task 3: Linear Regression model training + coefficient interpretation

✅ Task 4: Predictions with scatter plot + regression line visualization

✅ Task 5: Model evaluation (MAE, R² score with interpretation)
